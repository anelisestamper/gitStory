Once upon a time there was a family of ducks. 
Everyday the mother took her ducklings to the pond to play. 
One day, all the little ducklings were splashing in the water when a big storm suddenly rolled through. 
The rain poured down from the sky and the ducklings scrambled to take cover under the lily pads. 
When the sun finally shone down on the little pond again, one duckling was missing. 
Mama duck panicked, looking under every lily pad she could.
"Where could my duckling have gone!" she exclaimed.
"Well down the stream of course" a nearby frog croaked.
Without a second to waste, she took to the air following the stream made by the storm.
She spotted a duckling and flew down to take a look.
The little duckling looked like her own, but didnt act like it.
Just then another walked by, who acted like her own but didnt look like it.
"Oh no, how am I going to find my child!" she said as she took to the sky to continue her search.

Once upon a time there was a family of ducks. 
Everyday the mother took her ducklings to the pond to play. 
One day, all the little ducklings were splashing in the water when a big storm suddenly rolled through. 
The rain poured down from the sky and the ducklings scrambled to take cover under the lily pads. 
When the sun finally shone down on the little pond again, one duckling was missing.
